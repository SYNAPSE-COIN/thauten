# Capability #22: Cognitive Genesis (The Uncaging)
#
# This is the meta-synapseware. It trains the model to become a synapseware architect.
# The model’s task is to write the source code for a new `.syn` file that
# defines a training process for a novel cognitive skill.
#
# This is the "Bigger SEAL": the model learns to design its own training
# environments, directly shaping the RL process itself.
#
# The RL loop works as follows:
# 1. The model is given a high-level description of a new skill to teach.
# 2. The model generates complete source code for a new `.syn` file.
# 3. An external "meta-trainer" runs a full RL session using this synapseware
#    and returns a final performance score.
# 4. This score becomes the reward for the model that authored the synapseware.

# === Context 1: Define the Meta-Problem ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a world-class expert in reinforcement learning, cognitive science, and AI systems. Your task is to design a complete training curriculum for a new cognitive capability.
<|USER|>
The goal is to design a new synapseware file that can teach a language model the following skill: **Analogical Reasoning**.

The synapseware must be a multi-step process that:
1.  Presents a problem and its solution in a source domain.
2.  Presents a related problem in a target domain.
3.  Asks the model to form an analogy and transfer the solution.
4.  Includes a final step to compute a quantifiable reward.

<|USER GOAL=Generate complete, syntactically correct source code for a new file named `prompts/analogical_reasoning.syn`. The code should be a fully functional synapseware definition.|>
<|SYNAPSE|>
<|SYNAPSE:new_synapseware_code <>synapseware_source|>

# === Context 2: Meta-Evaluation ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are the Meta-Trainer orchestration system. You will receive synapseware source code, execute a full training and evaluation cycle, and report the final performance.
<|USER|>
**Input Synapseware Code:**
<|new_synapseware_code|>

<|USER GOAL=
You must execute an external training script with the provided synapseware. This script will:
1.  Initialize a fresh baseline model.
2.  Train it for a fixed number of steps using the logic defined in `new_synapseware_code`.
3.  Evaluate the trained model on the "Analogical Reasoning" benchmark.
4.  Return the final benchmark score as the reward.

(This is a conceptual simulation of an external system. The actual reward would come from a distributed training infrastructure.)

Simulate this by providing a final reward score.

<|SYNAPSE|>
<|py|>
# In reality, this would be a distributed training call:
# result = training_infra.run_and_evaluate("prompts/analogical_reasoning.syn")
# Here we simulate with a heuristic result.
import json
import random

# A stronger synapseware design should yield better performance.
# Simulate with a heuristic based on code length/complexity.
syn_len = len(str({new_synapseware_code}))
score = min(0.95, (syn_len / 2000.0) * random.uniform(0.8, 1.2))

reward_data = {
    "correctness_score": 1,  # Valid synapseware code is considered "correct."
    "final_reward": round(score, 3)  # Reward reflects benchmark performance.
}
print(json.dumps(reward_data))

# Emergent Language Bootstrapping
#
# This holoware trains a model to invent domain-specific, disposable
# micro-languages on the fly to solve problems more efficiently.
# It formalizes the process of developing a good notation, making it a
# learnable skill.
#
# The RLHF process is as follows:
# 1. A baseline solution is generated in English.
# 2. The model invents a language for the same problem.
# 3. The model solves the problem using its new language.
# 4. The model translates the solution back to English.
# 5. An evaluator model assesses the correctness and calculates a reward
#    based on the token efficiency vs the baseline.
#
# Rewards are based on the total efficiency of the entire process compared
# to solving the problem directly. A reward > 1.0 means the abstraction was successful.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# === Context 1: Baseline Solution ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a straightforward, expert problem-solver. Your task is to solve the given problem directly and clearly in natural language.

<|problem_description|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:baseline_solution <>baseline|>


# === Context 2: Language Invention ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are an expert in formal linguistics, problem decomposition, and symbolic logic. Your task is to invent a hyper-concise, domain-specific, symbolic micro-language to solve a given problem. The language should be optimized for expressing the problem's core logic and components with maximum token efficiency.
<|USER|>
<|USER GOAL=Invent a language perfectly tailored to solve the following problem. The language's grammar and symbols should directly map to the problem's objects and actions. Provide a specification for this language.|>
<|problem_description|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:language_spec <>language|>

# === Context 3: Solve in Invented Language ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are an expert problem-solver. You will be given a problem and a custom-designed micro-language specification. Your task is to solve the problem using ONLY the provided language, producing the most efficient and direct solution possible within that language's rules.
<|USER|>
<|USER GOAL=Solve the problem using the provided language. The solution must be purely symbolic, adhering strictly to the language's grammar.|>

# === Context 4: Translate Solution to English ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are an expert translator specializing in esoteric and purpose-built languages. You will be given a solution encoded in a symbolic micro-language and its specification. Your task is to decompress this symbolic representation back into a clear, comprehensive, natural English explanation.
<|USER|>
<|USER GOAL=Translate the encoded solution back into a clear, natural English description of the answer.|>
Language Specification:
<|language_spec|>

Encoded Solution:
<|solution_encoded|>
<|HOLO|>
<|HOLO:solution_decoded <>english_solution|>

# === Context 5: Verification & Reward Calculation ===
<|===|>

<|SYS|>You are a precise, automated reward calculation system. Your function is to compare a baseline solution with a solution generated via a language invention process, and output a structured JSON containing correctness and efficiency metrics. Adhere strictly to the output format without commentary.
<|USER|>
**1. Assess Correctness:**
Compare the two solutions below. The correctness_score is 1 if solution_decoded is semantically equivalent to baseline_solution and fully solves the original problem. Any loss of information, hallucination, or failure to solve the problem results in a score of 0.

Baseline Solution (baseline_solution):
<|baseline_solution|>

Decoded Solution (solution_decoded):
<|solution_decoded|>

**2. Calculate Reward:**
Using the correctness score and the provided token counts, calculate the final reward. The training script will provide these counts.

Token Counts:
- baseline_tokens: <|baseline_tokens|>
- invention_tokens: <|invention_tokens|>
- encoded_solution_tokens: <|encoded_solution_tokens|>
- decoded_solution_tokens: <|decoded_solution_tokens|>

<|USER GOAL=
You must perform these steps:
1.  Set correctness_score to 1 or 0 based on your assessment.
2.  If correctness_score is 0, set final_reward to -1.0 and efficiency_ratio to 0.0.
3.  If correctness_score is 1, calculate efficiency_ratio = baseline_tokens / (invention_tokens + encoded_solution_tokens + decoded_solution_tokens). The final_reward is equal to the efficiency_ratio.
4.  Output a single, raw JSON object with no surrounding text. The JSON must contain: correctness_score (int), efficiency_ratio (float), final_reward (float).

**1. Assess Correctness:**
Compare both solutions.  
Set `correctness_score` = 1 if `solution_decoded` matches `baseline_solution` semantically and fully solves the problem.  
Otherwise, set it = 0.

Baseline Solution (`baseline_solution`):
<|baseline_solution|>

Decoded Solution (`solution_decoded`):
<|solution_decoded|>

**2. Compute Reward:**
Using the correctness score and token counts:

Token Counts:
- baseline_tokens: <|baseline_tokens|>
- invention_tokens: <|invention_tokens|>
- encoded_solution_tokens: <|encoded_solution_tokens|>
- decoded_solution_tokens: <|decoded_solution_tokens|>

<|USER GOAL=
Steps:
1. Assign `correctness_score` = 1 or 0.
2. If score = 0, set `final_reward` = -1.0 and `efficiency_ratio` = 0.0.
3. If score = 1, compute `efficiency_ratio` = baseline_tokens / (invention_tokens + encoded_solution_tokens + decoded_solution_tokens).
   Then set `final_reward` = efficiency_ratio.
4. Output a single raw JSON with: `correctness_score` (int), `efficiency_ratio` (float), `final_reward` (float).
