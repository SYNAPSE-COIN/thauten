### 6. Causal Auditor

Train the model to run robust counterfactual rollouts—going past surface prediction to the causal machinery of a system (within the synapse stack).

- `<simulate c_if="var_a=2">`: Given a compressed system state, simulate its evolution under an intervention.
- `<explain_diff>`: Contrast baseline vs. counterfactual, narrating the causal chain that differs.
- Rewards favor causally sound, logically/physically plausible simulations as judged by a verifier.

RL loop:

1. **Context (A) – System Spec:** Provide a compressed baseline reality, `R_base`. Examples: physics, social setups, code snippets (e.g., `R_base = <compress>"A ball is at rest. A force of 10N is applied."</compress>`).
2. **Context (B) – Counterfactual Rollout:** Prompt an intervention (e.g., “What if the force were 20N?”). Model yields `R_cf` via `<simulate c_if="force=20N" over=R_base>...</simulate>`.
3. **Context (C) – Causal Narrative:** Model explains differences with `<explain_diff from=R_base to=R_cf>...</explain_diff>`.
4. **Context (D) – Check & Reward:** A checker (engine/interpreter) evaluates:
   * **Positive:** Accurate final state in `R_cf`.
   * **Positive:** Coherent causal links in the explanation.
   * **Negative:** Violations of logic or physics.

### 7. Cognitive Operator Specialization

Mesa-optimization in practice: the model critiques and refactors its own cognitive operators (SYNAPSE-style) to become more specialized and efficient.

- `<criticize "thought_process">`: Inspect a recent reasoning trace to locate waste or errors.
- `<refine_operator name="think">`: Propose a domain-tuned variant (e.g., `<think_math>` from `<think>`).
- Reinforcement rewards defining and using new, specialized operators that improve benchmark performance.

RL loop:

1. **Context (A) – Initial Solve:** Use general `<think>` to solve a domain task (e.g., hard algebra), possibly correct yet inefficient.
2. **Context (B) – Self-Critique:** “Critique the reasoning you just used.” Example: `<criticize "General steps weren’t algebra-focused; an axiomatic route would be tighter.">`.
3. **Context (C) – Refine:** “Propose a better operator.” Example: `<refine_operator name="think_algebraic">...</refine_operator>`; add it to the toolbelt.
4. **Context (D) – Re-solve:** Face a similar problem and select the best operator.
5. **Context (E) – Verify & Reward:**
   * **Positive:** Correct use of `<think_algebraic>`.
   * **Strong Positive:** Fewer tokens/steps than (A).
   * **Negative:** New operator is worse or fails.

1. **Context (A) – Observations:** Present anomalies or patterns (e.g., diet A correlates with faster recovery in a certain demographic).
2. **Context (B) – Hypotheses:** “Give three distinct testable explanations.” Example: `<hypothesize>[{"id":"H1","text":"A nutrient in diet A..."}, {"id":"H2","text":"Genetic predisposition..."}, {"id":"H3","text":"Confounder like exercise..."}]</hypothesize>`.
3. **Context (C) – Experiment:** “Design a test for H2.” → `<design_experiment for="H2">...</design_experiment>`.
4. **Context (D) – Verify & Reward:**
   * **Positive:** Falsifiable, varied hypotheses.
   * **Positive:** Ethical, direct experimental designs.
   * **Negative:** Vague/untestable ideas or flawed designs.

4. **Context (D) – Translate:** “Apply the source solution to the target.” → `<translate_solution>...</translate_solution>`.
5. **Context (E) – Verify & Reward:**
   * **Positive:** Practical, valid target solutions.
   * **High Positive:** Non-obvious, deeply structured analogies.
   * **Negative:** Superficial, non-functional mappings.

### 10. Cognitive Defragmentation

Meta-learning to optimize and refactor the model’s conceptual store—like tidying a codebase, but for knowledge (SYNAPSE memory hygiene).

- `<analyze_knowledge_base period="all">`: Scan compressed representations for duplication/overlap/fragmentation.
- `<refactor_concepts old="C1, C2" new="C_super" justification="...">`: Merge related ideas into a higher-level abstraction.

2. **Context (B) – Self-Analysis:** Trigger `<analyze_knowledge_base>...</analyze_knowledge_base>`.

2. **Context (B) – Distill:** “Find fundamental axioms.” → `<distill_axioms>...</distill_axioms>`.
3. **Context (C) – Rebuild & Test:** Replace original verifier with a simple logic runner using only proposed axioms; run tests.

   * **Positive:** Reconstructs test behaviors correctly.
